 ## User Senario
 a user is having a problem with his new device setup that he bought from Orange company. Help the poor user to have a chat with ChatBot Service that Orange compony provides to get him through his misery.
 
 
 ## Required Use Cases 
 - Once a user clicks on ChatBot a welcoming message will appear (maybe using componentDidMound? ;) ).
 - There should be a stored messages for each user choice. (ex. if user choose 1, FAQ will be sent).
 - Everytime a user send a message, you should validate it. if the message was incorrrect display "Please Insert Valid Input" for example.
 - If user wants to exit the chat, display rating component (maybe using componentWillUnmound? ;) ).
